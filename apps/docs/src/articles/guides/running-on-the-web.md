## Quick Start

In case you're going to start a new project with web support, the best way to do this is to use Expo. Follow the <a href='https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/' target='_blank'>Installation Guide</a> and then get back to the [Manual Installation](guides/getting-started#manual-installation) of UI Kitten.

## Existing Expo Applications

Read the great documentation from Expo team to <a href='https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/running-in-the-browser' target='_blank'>add web support in existing Expo projects</a>.

## Regular React Native Applications

In case you don't use Expo, and have already initialized React Native Application using `react-native init`, please follow <a href='https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/?path=/docs/guides-multi-platform--page' target='_blank'>official React Native Web Guide</a>.

## Conclusion

If you already have all in place, UI Kitten does not force you creating any additional web-specific configuration. The next step to create a multi-platform app would be [Branding](guides/branding) and launching it on both mobile device and browser.
