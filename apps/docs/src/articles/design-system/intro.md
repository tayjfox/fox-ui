## Principles

Eva is a customizable Design System based on Atomic Design Principles.
All components are built based on basic elements with shared styles, connected with a single Visual Language for both Mobile and Web platforms.
Most importantly, Eva is built to be customizable, meaning architectural support of multiple themes across all components and supporting platforms.
